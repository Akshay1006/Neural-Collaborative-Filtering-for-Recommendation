# Neural-Collaborative-Filtering-for-Recommendation

This is our implementation for the paper:

Xiangnan He, Lizi Liao, Hanwang Zhang, Liqiang Nie, Xia Hu and Tat-Seng Chua (2017). Neural Collaborative Filtering. In Proceedings of WWW '17, Perth, Australia, April 03-07, 2017.

Link for the paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05031.pdf

This implementation consists of both MF and MLP and a final concatenation of both the layers for imporved learning.

Dummy dataset used is provided as a sample in the folder 'dataset'.

This module is a Neural Network Implementation of traditional Collaborative Filtering approach which is commonly used for recommendation tasks.

# Environment Settings

We use Keras with Theano as the backend.
